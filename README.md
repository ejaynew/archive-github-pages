# ejaynew.github.io

## Description :speech_balloon:
A personal portfolio, built from scratch, to display my most recent projects.

## Technologies :information_desk_person:
HTML/CSS with Bootstrap and Devicon, as well as custom JavaScript. I used these technologies because I was already familiar with them and they are widely used in web development.

## How to use the project :grey_question:
Access the project at <a href="ejaynew.github.io" target="_blank">ejaynew.github.io</a>.

## Credits :pray:
I was inspired by the personal portfolio project from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy's</a> Full-Stack Engineer career path &mdash; shoutout to that course for being interactive and practical. I also referenced <a href="https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-smart-navbar-with-vanilla-javascript/" target="_blank">this tutorial by CSS Tricks</a> for the Navbar animation on scroll.
