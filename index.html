                <p>I work as a remote software engineer at Publicis Sapient, a digital consulting agency. I hold
                    a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon, where I developed a strong interest in
                    coding and
                    automation. I completed a manufacturing process engineering internship at Procter & Gamble, where I
                    gained
                    valuable experience in data analysis and improving plant efficiency. After graduating, I started as
                    a junior
                    software developer at Publicis Sapient, working on front-end development and coordinating email
                    campaigns.
                    Most recently, I was part of a small internal team focused on enhancing employee utilization through
                    executive dashboards and data improvements. I am Microsoft certified in Azure and PowerBI, with
                    proficiency
                    in various programming languages.</p>

                <p>I invite you to explore my portfolio of projects and accomplishments. By reviewing my work, you can
                    gain insights into my skills and expertise. If you have any questions or would like to discuss
                    potential collaborations or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me using the
                    provided contact information. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
